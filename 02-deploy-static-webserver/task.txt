First play should include the following:

• Verify that firewalld and httpd are installed in the latest version 

• Verify that firewalld and httpd services are up and running 

• Place index.html under /var/www/html in both nodes with a message “ My first web server on Ansible”. 

• Verify that the HTTP service is added to the firewall-config on production in runtime and permanently.

The second play should include the following:

• Using the uri Module, verify that index.html on managednode1 is reachable through the control node.
