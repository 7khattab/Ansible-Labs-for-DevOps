1- Create a custom static inventory file named inventory in the /home/admin/mylabproject 
working directory.

2- Use Ansible to list all managed nodes, ungrouped nodes, and Cairo Nodes.

3- Create a user named ‘devops’ on production hosts using Ansible Ad-hoc commands with
password ‘12345’. (Hint: Password to be hashed using sha512 and mysecret key)

4- Create an Ansible configuration file under /home/admin/mylabproject to use the inventory file

Created in step 1, and to connect to remote hosts through the user (devops).

5- Using Ansible, configure privilege escalation to use the root account with sudo without
password authentication.

6- Using Ansible, configure sudo configuration on the production group.

7- Using Ansible-doc, research the module debug to print a message named “ My first debug msg!”
after connecting to the production group.
