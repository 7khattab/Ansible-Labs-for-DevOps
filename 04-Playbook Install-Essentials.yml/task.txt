1) Create a playbook Install-Essentials.yml that installs 2 different packages and installs them on
each managed node so that:

. The First Managed node (managednode1) should have the tcpdump and git packages installed
by default.
. The 2nd Managed node (managednode2) should have Docker and MariaDB installed by
default.
. Run the playbook to install an additional 2 packages on both nodes: Docker and stratisd

2) Use the Ansible ad-hoc command to get the content of a vault.

. Create a YML file called sqlcredentials.yml that contains (user=root, password=dolfined).
. Encrypt this file by using Ansible Vaults.
. View the content of the sqlcredentials.yml file
. View the content of sqlcredentials.yml vault.

3) Collect Ansible facts about your local host.
