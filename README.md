## **1. 01-static-inventory-setup**

  **Description:**  
    This task demonstrates creating a custom static inventory in Ansible, configuring the `ansible.cfg` file to use it, and documenting the task details and solution. It         lays the foundation for managing groups of hosts efficiently.

  **Folder:** `01-static-inventory-setup`  
  **Files:**
      - `ansible.cfg` â€” Ansible configuration file pointing to the static inventory.
      - `inventory.ini` â€” Static inventory defining host groups (`production`, `cairo`, and ungrouped).
      - `task.txt` â€” Task requirements.
      - `answer.txt` â€” Commands and steps to complete the task.
